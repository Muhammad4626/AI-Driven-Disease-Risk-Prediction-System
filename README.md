Authors: Muhammad Muzammil & Syed Muhammad Afaq 
Type: Bachelorâ€™s Final Year Project (FYP)  

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the risk of post-flood diseases (Cholera, Malaria, and Dengue) in flood-affected districts of Pakistan using AI models trained on historical flood and health data.

NDMA analysts can input flood and environmental data, and the system provides:
- Disease risk predictions
- SHAP-based explanations
- Visual analytics (heatmaps, graphs, trends)

## System Modules
1. Frontend
2. Backend
3. Flood Cache & Trigger 
4. AI Model 
5. Prediction & Inference
6. Explainability (SHAP)  
7. Visualization & Analytics
